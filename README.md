# Project FeedBoston
Self-learning project designed to mimic and potentially employ the ideas used at Feeding South Florida's new program: MealConnect, to create an application designed in a similar manner for proceeds to The Greater Boston Food Bank.


NOTE: This project is on hold: mastery of HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and SQL is required (by my standards) to start!
